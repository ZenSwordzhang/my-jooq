server.host: "0.0.0.0"
server.name: "kibana01"

# -------------------- Configure security in Kibana --------------------
# 1.Configure security in Elasticsearch.

# 2.Configure Kibana to use the appropriate built-in user
# es配置了transport.ssl认证后，此处需指定账号密码
# elasticsearch.username: "elastic"
# elasticsearch.password: "123456"

# 3.Set the xpack.security.encryptionKey property in the kibana.yml configuration file
# An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials in a cookie.
# It is crucial that this key is not exposed to users of Kibana.
# By default, a value is automatically generated in memory.
# If you use that default behavior, all sessions are invalidated when Kibana restarts.
# xpack.security.encryptionKey: "9993cdc9-883c-404a-9309-d54824fc8eac"

# 4.Optional: Set a timeout to expire idle sessions.
# By default, a session stays active until the browser is closed.
# The idle timeout is formatted as a duration of <count>[ms|s|m|h|d|w|M|Y] (e.g. 70ms, 5s, 3d, 1Y).
# xpack.security.session.idleTimeout: "30d"

# 5.Optional: Change the maximum session duration or "lifespan" — also known as the "absolute timeout".
# By default, a session stays active until the browser is closed.
# The lifespan is formatted as a duration of <count>[ms|s|m|h|d|w|M|Y] (e.g. 70ms, 5s, 3d, 1Y).
# xpack.security.session.lifespan: "8h"

# 6.Optional: Configure Kibana to encrypt communications.

# 7.Optional: Configure Kibana to authenticate to Elasticsearch with a client certificate.

# 8.Restart Kibana.

# 9.Choose an authentication mechanism and grant users the privileges they need to use Kibana.

# 10.Grant users access to the indices that they will be working with in Kibana.

# 11.Verify that you can log in as a user.


# -------------------- Encrypt traffic between the browser and Kibana --------------------
# 配置ssl认证后，需使用https访问，如 https://localhost:5601/

# 1.Obtain a server certificate and private key for Kibana

# 2.Configure Kibana to access the server certificate and private key.
server.ssl.certificate: ${CERTS_DIR_KIBANA}/tsl_ssl/client.crt
server.ssl.key: ${CERTS_DIR_KIBANA}/tsl_ssl/client.key

# 3.Configure Kibana to enable TLS for inbound connections.
server.ssl.enabled: true

# 4.Restart Kibana.


# -------------------- Encrypt traffic between Kibana and Elasticsearch --------------------

# 1.Enable TLS on the HTTP layer in Elasticsearch.

# 2.Obtain the certificate authority (CA) certificate chain for Elasticsearch.

# 3.Configure Kibana to trust the Elasticsearch CA certificate chain for the HTTP layer.
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: ["${CERTS_DIR_KIBANA}/tsl_ssl/ca.crt"]

# 4.Configure Kibana to enable TLS for outbound connections to Elasticsearch
# es配置了http.ssl认证后，此处需用https请求
elasticsearch.hosts: ["https://es02:9200"]


## -------------------- Public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication --------------------
## Using a PKI realm is a gold feature.
#
#server.ssl.certificateAuthorities: ${CERTS_DIR_KIBANA}/tsl_ssl/ca.crt
#server.ssl.clientAuthentication: required
#xpack.security.authc.providers:
#  pki.pki1:
#    order: 0
